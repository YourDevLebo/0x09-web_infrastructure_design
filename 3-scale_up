Answer:
	We have added 1 more server, we now hav 3 servers. We distributed the 
	appliaction server, webserver, and database with in their own server.
	Now they became a cluster server, which is what happens when a group of 
	servers works as a unit. We will also add another HAproxy loadbalancer 
	to distribute work load among the 3 servers.
